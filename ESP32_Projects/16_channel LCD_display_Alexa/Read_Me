In the previous projects we covered how to use Alexa and an ESP8266 to operate 4 relays,
an ESP32S to operate 16 relays, explain the I2C bus and how to use an LCD to show you the status
of 4 relays.
This part expands on all of the others. Here we will show you how to use 4 I2C devices that all have
the same address by using an I2C multplexor and have it show the status of all 16 relays.
Watch this video for a full explination of this Arduino sketch and how to use multiple I2C devices
at the same time that have the same addresses.
